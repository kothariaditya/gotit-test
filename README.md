# gotit-test
This repository is for my interview test for Gotit! Inc. 
It holds the code used to parse a json file (problem_times.json) containing timestamps and 
create different graphs to analyse the frequency of those timestamps.
I have written a python script using the datetime, json and matplotlib (pylpot) libraries to complete this project.
